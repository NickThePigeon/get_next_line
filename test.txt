Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.
Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she
She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

Candy came from out on the island
In the backroom, she was everybody's darlin'
But she never lost her head
Even when she was givin' head
She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
